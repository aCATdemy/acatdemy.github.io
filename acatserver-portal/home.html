					<p class="text-dark">Dear aCATServer members,</p>
					<p class="text-dark">I require your help in suggesting the features that will be integrated into aCATServer 1.17. I assure everyone that your suggestions will be read through and not be thrown into the bin, so long as it is something sensible.</p>
					<p class="text-dark">You may fill up the suggestion e-form <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQH2SQRP4Cnh-H1jB1BzuTgBUZlGChP11AvwNdeM3mNFAyYA/viewform?usp=sf_link" class="font-weight-bold" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

					<p class="text-dark">The website is finally fully functional after adding the last few pages!</p>
					<p class="text-dark">First, the <a href="knowledge-base.html" class="font-weight-bold">Knowledge Base</a>, or KB. The KB is a useful page for aCATServer members to track the issues which are causing the server to have a dip in its performance. Besides, members can view whether the issues have been resolved.</p>
					<p class="text-dark">Next, the <a href="support.html" class="font-weight-bold">Support</a> page. You can open a ticket using the e-form for issues like reporting another player, bugs, etc. In addition, there is a link to the official Minecraft support page.</p>

					<br>
					<small class="text-muted font-italic">26 November 2020, 07:45</small>

					<p class="text-dark">The server rules have been implemented. You can access them <a href="server-rules.html" class="font-weight-bold">here</a> or by the navigation bar under <span class="font-weight-bold">Server Rules</span>. All members are expected to read the rules and adhere to it at all times when playing on the server. The rules and sanctions are listed clearly on the page, and there will be no excuses for not following them.</p>
					<p class="text-dark font-weight-bold">Please also note that some rules will not be listed as they should already be known to you based on your common sense. So, do not even attempt to try your luck by saying, "The rules aren't listed and I should not be punished!"</p>
					<p class="text-dark">If you are trying to find loopholes to exploit, I'd rather suggest you dig a grave for your Minecraft account because...&#128513;</p>

					<h3 class="text-dark font-weight-bold">aCATdemy's Address: Upcoming Minecraft 1.17 Server</h3>
					<small class="text-muted font-italic">Author: aCATdemy</small>
					<br>
					<small class="text-muted font-italic">14 November 2020, 06:45 (updated: 26 November 2020, 07:44)</small>
					<hr>
					<p class="text-dark">To all members of my Minecraft server,</p>
					<p class="text-dark">Allow me to start off by warmly welcoming you on this journey towards my Minecraft 1.17 server! Almost a year has passed since my Minecraft 1.16 server was shut down. It was a unique experience especially for me since that was my first time handling a server so in-depth. I have to admit that I did not do a good job back then as a server owner in terms of moderation, and I sincerely apologise for it. The way I moderate the server back then has created a line of fire between groups of people. It appears clear to me that I really did not anticipate that situation in my mind before creating the server. Looking at the bright side, waves have calmed, the fire is extinguished, and everyone is back on track. Thank you for your maturity and understanding that this situation happened in a video game and is not worth fighting over in real life.</p>
					<p class="text-dark">Now, please allow me to share the upcoming plans for my Minecraft 1.17 server.</p>
					<p class="text-dark">First and foremost, I am excited to announce that my server will have its own official name, aCATServer. So, don't be surprised to see this new name in future posts! There is nothing much to elaborate here, hence we will move on to the more important topics.</p>
					<p class="text-dark">Next, I have decided to come up with a list of rules and punishments which will be published at the same time. While I understand it can be quite a pain in the ass to play on a server with rules, I do wish to seek your understanding that these rules are in place to ensure this server will be a place for everyone to enjoy. However, I can too, anticipate that some people will still choose to not follow the rules and create troubles for the server. More information will be shared in the upcoming months of how the server will deal with such cases of nuisance.</p>
					<p class="text-dark">Secondly, this server will have plug-ins installed to spice up the joy of Minecraft. Of course, these plug-ins will not be too over-powered or broken as it will ruin the fun of the server after all. I will start off with the good news by listing the plug-ins that will be installed below:</p>
					<ol>
						<li class="text-dark">/tpa</li>
						<li class="text-dark">/sethome</li>
					</ol>
					<p class="text-dark">As Gayle Forman once said, "<span class="font-weight-bold">You win some, you lose some.</span>" Since there are plug-ins enabled, the loss would be mobGriefing being turned on, whilst the win being keepInventory enabled for all everyone!</p>
					<p class="text-dark">It is estimated that Minecraft 1.17 will be set to sail next summer, which is probably 6 months away from now. In the meantime, I hope all of you are living in the pink of health.</p>
					<p class="text-dark font-italic">Yours faithfully,</p>
