				<p><span class="fontBold">Server Guidelines:</span> The server guidelines page shows the list of guidelines aCATServer Network members are required to follow. As stated, members are strongly encouraged to read through them.</p>
				<p><span class="fontBold">Knowledge Base:</span> The knowledge base page shows the list of issues or problems encountered as the server runs. Members should check this page to understand the stability of the server.</p>
				<p><span class="fontBold">Support:</span> The support page gives you two options to choose: aCATServer Network support and the official Minecraft support.</p>
				<br>
				<p>With that, I assure everyone that the maintenance of this portal will continue as long as the server is alive.</p>

				<p>Dear aCATServer Network members,</p>
				<p>The server guidelines have been implemented and will be effective once the server starts. All members are encouraged to read through and understand them to defend yourselves in the event of a sanction dispute.</p>
				<p>On that note, I will be enforcing the server guidelines more strictly this time.</p>

				<h2 class="textBlack">aCATdemy's Address: Upcoming 1.17 Server</h2>
				<small class="textGrey">Author: aCATdemy</small>
				<br>
				<small class="textGrey">9 December 2020, 15:26</small>
				<p>To all members invited to join my Minecraft server,</p>
				<p>Allow me to start by warmly welcoming you on this journey towards my Minecraft 1.17 server! Almost a year has passed since my Minecraft 1.16 server was shut down. It was a unique experience especially for me since that was my first time handling a server so in-depth. I have to admit that I did not do a good job back then as a server owner in terms of moderation, and I sincerely apologise for it. The way I moderate the server back then has created a line of fire between groups of people. It appears clear to me that I did not anticipate that situation in my mind before creating the server. Looking at the bright side, waves have calmed, the fire is extinguished, and everyone is back on track. Thank you for your maturity and understanding that this situation happened in a video game and is not worth fighting over in real life.</p>
				<p>Now, please allow me to share the upcoming plans for my Minecraft 1.17 server.</p>
				<p>First and foremost, I am excited to announce that my server will have its official name, aCATServer Network. Besides, the portal will have its name too, aCATServer Portal.</p>
				<p>Next, I have decided to come up with a list of rules and punishments which will be published at the same time. While I understand it can be quite a pain in the ass to play on a server with rules, I do wish to seek your understanding that these rules are in place to ensure this server will be a place for everyone to enjoy. However, I can too, anticipate that some people will still choose to not follow the rules and create troubles for the server. More information will be shared in the upcoming months of how the server will deal with such cases of nuisance.</p>
				<p>Secondly, depending on the feasibility, this server may have plug-ins installed to spice up the joy of Minecraft. Of course, these plug-ins will not be too over-powered or broken as it will ruin the fun of the server after all. If feasible, the plug-ins that will be installed would be <span class="fontItalic">/tpa</span> and <span class="fontItalic">/sethome</span>.</p>
				<p>As Gayle Forman once said, <span class="fontBold">"You win some, you lose some"</span>. Still, the loss would be mobGriefing being turned on, whilst the win being keepInventory enabled for all everyone! This is carried over from the previous 1.16 server.</p>
				<p>It is estimated that Minecraft 1.17 will be set to sail in Q2 2021, which is probably 4 to 6 months away from now. In the meantime, I hope all of you are living in the pink of health.</p>
				<p class="fontItalic">Yours faithfully,</p>
